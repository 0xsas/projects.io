## [Project 1: Income Analysis](https://github.com/0xsas/Portfolio.io/tree/main/Files/ecommerce)

Aim:

In this project, we help a (fictitious) eCommerce company fit several machine learning techniques to predict its customer income, and classify their customers based on their income, so they know how best to price their new product and decide on marketing. 
We begin by exploring the data collected by the eCommerce company, analysing, and applying a set of machine learning algorithms based on features like the customers' age, how much time they spend on their website, what sector and region these customers work in, to predict estimated figures of their income using some regression algorithms. Next, we determine an income benchmark, then apply a binary classification technique to determine if a customerâ€™s income is above or below this benchmark. We then round up by applying some clustering models to identify what features customers within an income bracket possess and try to group them based on these features.

Objectives: 

First hand Experience with;
 - Data Exploration
 - Regression Analysis.
 - Classification and Clustering
 - Neural Network
